This is my university dissertation code for optimising the Formula 1 race calendar. The problem is modelled as a travelling salesman problem and solved using a genetic algorithm.
Each distance between racetracks is calculated based on their geographical coordinates. By applying genetic algorithm techniques such as selection, crossover, and mutation, an optimised sequence for the F1 race calendar is determined.
If implemented in the real world, this could have huge environmental and economical benefits.
To enhance the realism of the model, three constraints are then incorporated into the algorithm. These are: avoiding consecutive races in the same country, accounting for weather-related restrictions, and adhering to traditional race scheduling.
